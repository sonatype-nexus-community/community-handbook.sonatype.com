You can share your idea for a new Project by starting a [Discussion here](https://github.com/orgs/sonatype-nexus-community/discussions/new?category=project-proposal).

[Organization Admins](../community_roles/admin.md) can execute the below procedure to create new Project within the Sonatype Open Source Community.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have defined a clear purpose for the new project
- [Maintaniers](../community_roles/maintainer.md) of the project must have previously contributed to another Sonatype Open Source Project

Having contributed previously means you'll have signed our CLA and understand our Community workflows.

## Creating the Project

- Create a new GitHub Repository in the [Sonatype Community GitHub Organization](https://github.com/organizations/sonatype-nexus-community/repositories/new) using the [Community Project Template](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/community-project-template) as the template repository

    This will cause a number of default files to be placed into your new repository.
    It will also automatically inherit a number of Organization defined files that you do not need to redefine in your project.

### GitHub Repository Configuration

See our [GitHub Repository Configuration Standards]({{< ref "/docs/standards/github-repository" >}}).
