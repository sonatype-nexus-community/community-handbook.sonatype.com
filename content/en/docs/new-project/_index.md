{{< alert title="Note" >}}Only Sonatype Employees can execute the below procedure to create new Project within the Sonatype Open Source Community.{{< /alert >}}

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have defined a clear purpose for the new project

## Creating the Project

- Create a new GitHub Repository in the [Sonatype Community GitHub Organization](https://github.com/organizations/sonatype-nexus-community/repositories/new) using the [Community Project Template](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/community-project-template) as the template repository

    This will cause a number of default files to be placed into your new repository.
    It will also automatically inherit a number of Organization defined files that you do not need to redefine in your project.

### GitHub Repository Configuration

See our [GitHub Repository Configuration Standards]({{< ref "/docs/standards/github-repository" >}}).
