While many of these open source efforts are supported by contributors from Sonatype, these Open Source Projects are not officially supported through Sonatype's commercial support channels.

Please review the latest pull requests, issues, and commits to understand a projects readiness for contribution and use.

**DO** file suggestions and requests on the project in question using GitHub Issues, so that the community can pitch in and [maintainers](../community_roles/maintainer.md) can easily find your input.

**DO** use or contribute to a Sonatype Open Source Project according to your organization's policies and your own risk tolerance.

**DON'T** file Sonatype support tickets related to a Sonatype Open Source Project â€” it won't reach the right people that way.

Last but not least of all: Have fun!
