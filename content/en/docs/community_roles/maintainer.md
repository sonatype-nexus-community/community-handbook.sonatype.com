The Project Maintainer is the backbone of a project's success, balancing technical leadership with community engagement. They curate contributions, ensure code quality, and manage project direction. With an eye for detail and a commitment to the project's vision, maintainers foster an inclusive and collaborative environment, enabling consistent growth and innovation.

## How to Become a Maintainer

Contributors who demonstrate consistent commitment to a project, offering meaningful improvements and actively engaging in discussions, may be considered for a maintainer role.

Becoming a maintainer requires building long-term trust with the Organizational Admins and the project’s existing maintainers. This trust is earned through high-quality contributions, design proposals, and a clear understanding of the project's vision.

Maintainers not only contribute technically but also help guide the project’s direction by reviewing PRs, managing issues, and fostering collaboration within the community.
