A Project Contributor plays a pivotal role in shaping the project through code, documentation, or design. Whether fixing bugs, implementing features, or enhancing the user experience—contributors bring fresh perspectives and energy. Their work supports the project’s evolution, bridging the gap between the project's goals and the community's needs.

This role does not require any permissions on the GitHub Project.

## How to Become a Contributor

You can be a Contributor by opening a Pull Request following our [guidelines on submitting a contribution](/docs/contributing/submitting/).

For your contribution to be accepted, each individual must sign our <abbr title="Contributor License Agreement">CLA</abbr>, ensuring that their contributions comply with our legal requirements.

_Paul Botsco_ (our friendly <abbr title="Contributor License Agreement">CLA</abbr> Bot) will comment on your first pull request, providing you with the latest links and helpful information. It will also provide feedback should you have missed any of our [contribution guidelines](/docs/contributing/submitting/#contribution-requirements).

Once the <abbr title="Contributor License Agreement">CLA</abbr> is signed, contributors can engage with the project by opening issues to report bugs, request features, or suggest improvements. They can also submit pull requests (PRs) to offer code, documentation, or design enhancements.

In the rare event that the <abbr title="Contributor License Agreement">CLA</abbr> text is updated, Paul Botsco will comment on your next pull request to guide you through the process again.

This role does not require any permissions changes.
